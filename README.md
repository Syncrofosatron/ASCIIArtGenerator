I was looking over the Internet for "Real life programming projects" and I came across this amazing
website, here's the link if you want to try: https://robertheaton.com
Don't take the projects as a tutorial, what you will find there is the IDEA of how the thing is working and everything else,
you will have to do it and believe me, it all worth's the wait and the sweat.

So about this project.
1. If you want to generate ASCII art of a digital image, first resize it to in around 50-150 range (I'll add the feature to automatically resize later).
2. Now, get the location of the file and mention it in the source code. I have commented the place where you can do that (You an copy the path of the image file too).
3. Now, just build the project, after the decoding and execution the results you will get is what this project is about.

Requirements: OpenCV Library for Image Processing.

This project is written in C++ and the IDE used is Visual Studio 2019.
